# Numerical Integration Project Site
I am creating an article about numeric integration as a way to learn web development. The website will eventually contain an overview of numeric integration and an interactive numeric integration calculator.

This project was chartered so I could practice the following:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Numeric Methods
* GitHub
