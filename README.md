# Numerical Integration Project Site
I am creating an article about numerical integration as a way to learn web development. The website will eventually contain an overview of numerical integration and an interactive numerical integration calculator.

This project was chartered so I could practice the following:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Python
* Numeric Methods
* GitHub

[site index page](https://adam-ballinger.github.io/nips/)

Todo:
- [ ] Integration overview
- [ ] Numerical integration overview
- [ ] Engineering applications for integration
- [ ] Numerical integration methods
- [ ] User function input
- [ ] Numerical integration calculator with select methods
- [ ] Methods comparison
- [ ] Error analysis
- [ ] Cost analysis
