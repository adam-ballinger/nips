        <p>An <strong>integral</strong> is the space under the graph of a function, most commonly referred
            to as <em>the area under the curve</em>. <strong>Integration</strong>, then, is simply the
            <em>process</em> of <em>finding</em> the area under the curve

            Figure 1 shows the relationship between a function and the area under the curve.

        <p>Integrating is required to solve innumerous problems in math, science, and engineering. In general, 
            integration will be useful any time change is accumulating. For example, consider a jet travelling
            at 1,800 feet per second. Every second the jet's position changes by 1,800 feet. Over time, the jet's
            change in position accumulates, and the integral represents the total distance traveled. This is true
            whether the jet's velocity is constant or variable. Figure 2 shows a common application of integral
            calculus.

    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <p>There are two general methods to finding Integrals: <strong>Analytical</strong> and
            <strong>Numerical</strong>.
        <p><strong>Analytical methods</strong> result in <em>exact</em> solutions, found with mathematical theorems. 
            The advantages of analytical methods is that they are exact (no error), and some solutions can be
            calculated very quickly using known theorems. The disadvantages of analytical methods is that they aren't
            always easy to calculate, or even possible. Analytical methods can only be applied to narrow classes
            of functions; different methods are required for different functions.
        <p><strong>Numerical methods</strong> return <em>approximations</em>, not exact solutions. Although they
            are approximate, they can be very accurate. Numerical methods are used when analytical solutions
            are impossible or inefficient. Most popular methods can be applied to a broad range of functions. The
            disadvantages of numerical methods is that they are not exact, and they entail a great deal of
            processing, requiring computers.
