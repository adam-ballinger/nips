        <p>This article is an introduction to numerical integration. The article starts with a brief overview of
            integrals and numerical methods, contains example problems, and features a numerical integration
            calculator. The article concludes with an error/cost analysis of the featured numerical integration 
            methods.

        <p>An <strong>integral</strong> is the space under the graph of a function, most commonly referred
            to as <em>the area under the curve</em>. <strong>Integration</strong>, then, is simply the
            <em>process</em> of <em>finding</em> the area under the curve

        <p>Integrating is required to solve innumerous problems in math, science, and engineering. In general, 
            integration will be useful any time change is accumulating. For example, consider a jet travelling
            at 1,800 feet per second. Every second the jet's position changes by 1,800 feet. Over time, the jet's
            change in position accumulates, and the integral represents the total distance traveled. This is true
            whether the jet's velocity is constant or variable. Figure 2 shows a common application of integral
            calculus.

        <p>In this article, we will only evaluate <strong>definite integrals</strong>, and so we will use the terms
            integral and definite integral interchangably. Definite integrals have defined bounds between which to
            integrate (see <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in Figure 2).

          Methods: Analytical vs. Numerical</a>
    </h2>  
    <div class="section">
      <div>
        <p>There are two general methods to finding integrals: <strong>Analytical</strong> and
            <strong>Numerical</strong>.
        <p><strong>Analytical methods</strong> result in <em>exact</em> solutions, found with mathematical theorems. 
            The advantages of analytical methods is that they are exact (no error), and some solutions can be
            calculated very quickly using known theorems. The disadvantages of analytical methods is that they aren't
            always easy to calculate, or even possible. Analytical methods can only be applied to narrow classes
            of functions; different methods are required for different functions.
        <p><strong>Numerical methods</strong> return <em>approximations</em>, not exact solutions. Although they
            are approximate, they can be very accurate. Numerical methods are used when analytical solutions
            are impossible or inefficient. Most popular methods can be applied to a broad range of functions. The
            disadvantages of numerical methods is that they are not exact, and they entail a great deal of
            processing; requiring computers.
        <p>Numerical methods are also required when integrating a set of discrete points, rather than a continuous
            function. More on this below.

        <p>There are many numerical integration methods, varying in complexity, error, and computation time (cost).
          Generally, error can be reduced with increased cost: performing more iterations (increased cost) can lead
          to less error. Methods often build on one another, leading to more complex algorithms with less error for
          the same cost. Complex algorithms take more time to develop, but once developed, they are able to
          approximate integrals more efficiently.
        <p>We will explore numerical integration methods one by one, starting with the most simple, advancing to the
            most complex.
